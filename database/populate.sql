However, it is possible, using either VMware Workstation Player or Oracle VirtualBox, to run Window 95 as a “virtual machine”, or VM. Running an operating system as a VM means that the virtualization software tricks the operating system into thinking it’s running directly on the metal-plastic-and-silicon hardware of a computer, when in fact, though it has an image file to load into RAM, the VM is available only as long as the virtualization software is active and the VM has been started and loaded into RAM.\nIt’s far safer, unless one absolutely must use Windows 95 on bare metal, as in points #3 and #4 above, to run Windows 95 in a virtualized environment. Anyway, Windows 95 won’t run on more modern hardware, and must never run directly on solid-state drive hardware.

A blockchain is a type of database. To be able to understand blockchain, it helps to first understand what a database actually is.\nA database is a collection of information that is stored electronically on a computer system. Information, or data, in databases is typically structured in table format to allow for easier searching and filtering for specific information. What is the difference between someone using a spreadsheet to store information rather than a database?\nSpreadsheets are designed for one person, or a small group of people, to store and access limited amounts of information. In contrast, a database is designed to house significantly larger amounts of information that can be accessed, filtered, and manipulated quickly and easily by any number of users at once.\nLarge databases achieve this by housing data on servers that are made of powerful computers. These servers can sometimes be built using hundreds or thousands of computers in order to have the computational power and storage capacity necessary for many users to access the database simultaneously. While a spreadsheet or database may be accessible to any number of people, it is often owned by a business and managed by an appointed individual that has complete control over how it works and the data within it.\nIf you want to know more details: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blockchain.asp', TIMESTAMP '2020-10-08 15:48:11', false, 54, NULL, 260, true);
